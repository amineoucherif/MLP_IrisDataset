# MLP_IrisDataset
This repository contains a script code which classifies the famous Iris Dataset.
Here we are generating a machine learning algorithm based on the MLP artificial neural network architecture, to classify the 3 types of the Iris species.
This dataset contains 150 samples, each sample is caracterized by 4 attributes.
